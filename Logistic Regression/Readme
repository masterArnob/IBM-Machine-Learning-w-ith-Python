Customer Churn Prediction Model: Logistic Regression

In this project, I utilized Logistic Regression to develop a predictive model for a telecommunications company. The model estimates the likelihood of customers switching to a competitor (churning). By identifying at-risk customers early, the company can take proactive steps to retain them, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn.
Key Objectives:

    Predict customer churn based on historical data.
    Enable the company to intervene early and retain customers before they switch to competitors.

Skills and Techniques:

    Logistic Regression for binary classification.
    Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, handling missing data, and encoding categorical variables.
    Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve to assess model performance.
