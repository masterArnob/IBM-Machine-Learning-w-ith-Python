# Human Cell Classification Model: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In this project, I utilized **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to develop a predictive model for classifying human cell samples. The model identifies whether a given cell sample is **benign** or **malignant**, aiding in early detection and diagnosis. By effectively categorizing cells, this model contributes to improving medical decision-making and patient outcomes.

## Key Objectives:
- **Classify human cell samples** as benign or malignant.
- Leverage SVM to **map data to a high-dimensional feature space** and identify a separating hyperplane for optimal classification.

## Skills and Techniques:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for binary classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, converting categorical values to numeric, and standardizing features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model performance.
