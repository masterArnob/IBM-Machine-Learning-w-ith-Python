# Australian Rainfall Prediction Model (Final Project)

In this project, which serves as my final project, we aim to predict rainfall in Australia using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains historical rainfall data, and the objective is to build and evaluate models to predict rainfall outcomes.

## Algorithms Used:
- **Linear Regression**: Used to model the relationship between rainfall and various features.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applied to binary classification problems, especially to predict if the rainfall is above a threshold.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks.

## Model Evaluation Metrics:
We will evaluate our models using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
- **R2-Score**: A statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
